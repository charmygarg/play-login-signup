Play Assignment [Day-4][Google Guice]


Given :  An application supporting user sign-up, sign-in and profile-view. Used play cache as temporary storage [Database replacement]. All types of response errors are handled and validations are in place for sign-up and sign-in actions. Proper redirections and sessions are maintained, also each user is uniquely identified by email/username. Passwords for each user should be stored in encrypted format.

Augmentation : Add google guice injection to the service, domains and controllers to support dependency injection at run-time. Add another boolean field inside User class to identify type for each user [Admin/Normal].

Read user-type from configuration file and If the user-type is set as Admin in configuration file, any new user created will be of Admin type and should be able to see all other users in the system, should be able to suspend/resume account of any particular user from the system and deny/allow their login capability. The profile page for admin users should have additional buttons to facilitate this.

[Redirect to management page/view and perform suspend/resume any user]

Acceptance Criteria : Stick to the SOLID principles for designing the application. All the existing functionality should be kept as is and should not break due to the new changes. Try to use as many concepts from Guice DI session. The more the better.

Try to add providers in the code and move configuration reading inside the services and not within the Guice Module.
